### Profile
I am a professional Epidemiologist with a Master of Public Health from the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. During my time at Mailman, I conducted extensive research on breast cancer, which was also the focus of my thesis. I also have international research experience spanning from my internship in France where I spent a summer studying the assessment of the contraction of Hepatitis C among people who inject drugs in various European countries. These substantive experiences have provided me with a wealth of opportunities to analyze quantitative and qualitative data together as I have been able to utilize statistical platforms such as RStudio, GIS and Dedoose to preform exploratory analyses and predictive modeling. I am striving to collaborate and grow in an innovative and dynamic environment and I believe the skills I have acquired through my various classes and experiences will make me a tremendous asset to your organization.

### Other websites

The website below was done for a class assignment. My group members and I were curious of food insecurities in the five boroughs of New York. We assessed the rates of food insecurity in each borough and did some explaratory analysis on the data that we found. We also created a page that would provide resources to indviduals with healthy food choices for each borough.
