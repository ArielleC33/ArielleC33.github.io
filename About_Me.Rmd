My name is Arielle Coq, I was born in and raised in upstate New York. I am a 23 year old Haitian-American, who is currently attending Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health recieving a master's degrees in Epidemiology. I attended  SUNY University at Albany where I recieved my bachelor's of science degree in Public Health with a minor in Biology and Emergency Preparedness, CyberSecurity, and Homeland Security. 

I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, playing and watching sports mostly tennis, basketball, soccer, and track and field. I also enjoy reading and traveling in my free time and with proper funds. Some of my favorite places that I have been to are Greece and France. A continent that is on my list to travel to is Africa and visit multiple countries on the homeland. I enjoy exploring the parks and museums that New York City has to offer. When the weather is nice I like to walk on Riverside Drive or head down to Central Park and have picnics with frineds.
