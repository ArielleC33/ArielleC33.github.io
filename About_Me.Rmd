My name is Arielle Coq, I was born in and raised in upstate New York. I am a 23 year old Haitian- American, who is currently at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health recieving a master's degrees in Epidemiology. I attended University at Albany SUNY where I recieved my bachelor's of science degree in Public Health with a minor in Biology and Emergency Preparedness, CyberSecurity, and Homeland Security. I enjoy spending time with my family, playing and watching sports mostly tennis, basketball, soccer, and track and field. I also enjoy reading in my free time and traveling when I have the funds and the time too. Some of my favorite places that I have been to are Greece and France. A continent that is on my list to travel to is Africa and visiting multiple countries on the homeland.
