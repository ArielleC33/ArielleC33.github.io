My name is Arielle Coq, I was born in and raised in upstate New York. I am a 23 year old Haitian-American, graduated from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health recieving a master's degree of Public Health in Epidemiology. My concentration for my Master's degree was in epidemiology of chronic disease. I was a graduate research assistant at the University researching breast cancer specifically breast density during the time of program. I wrote my master's thesis paper assessing whether doctor discussion with patients regarding mammography screening as a choice was asscociated with mammogram screening frequency among women 50 years and older. I am working on a manuscript of my thesis paper for publication. I attended SUNY University at Albany, where I recieved my bachelor's of science degree in Public Health with a minor in Biology and Emergency Preparedness, CyberSecurity, and Homeland Security. 

I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, playing and watching sports mostly tennis, basketball, soccer, and track and field. I also enjoy reading and traveling in my free time and with proper funds. Some favorite places that I have been to are Greece and France. Given the current pandemic of Coronavirus Covid - 19 I have not been able to travel the way that I would have liked in 2020. However when it is safe to do so again, Africa is a continent that is at the top of my list, for there are several countries that I would like to visit. Some of my favorite books are Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Becoming by Michelle Obama, and A Letter to my Daughter by Maya Angelou. I enjoy exploring the parks and museums that New York City has to offer. When the weather is nice I like to walk on Riverside Drive or head down to Central Park and have picnics with friends.
